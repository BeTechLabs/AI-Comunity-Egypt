# AI Community Homework Solutions
This Rep is dedicated to AI &amp; Machine Learning exercises for the Egyptian AI Community ran by Benchmark Tech Lab. Each meetup will have a dedicated folder containing solutions to some of the problems we had as a homework. We will use Python programing language to solve the homework, with Jupyter IDE Notebooks as source code.


## Enviroment Preperations
- Python 3: Follow the guide in [this link](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/) to install Python 3 on Ubuntu or any other linux distribution and [this link](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/) for Mack.
